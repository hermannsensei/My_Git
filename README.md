# My_Git 
My_Git is all my aliases for git commands.

If you're also frustrated because you always forget git commands each time
you want to use them, you will find my interface better. You can also use this
as an inspiration to build your own interface. 
My interface is inpired from **Git from Humans** by Kenneth Rietz.
All contributions are welcome.

## How to use

You just need to copy all the aliases in the aliases.txt to a .bash_aliases
file in your home directory.

touch .bash_aliases to create the file.
nano .bash_aliases to open it and copy the aliases

source ~/.bash_aliases to load it each time you want to use it.

## Interface 

* repo='git init'
* clone='git clone'
* add='git add'
* save='git commit -m'
* save_ch='git commit -am'
* state='git status'
* branches='git branch'
